Example React Native app. It accesses the Yelp Fusion REST api to display a list of restaurants categorized by price.

You need to get a Yelp Fusion api key here: https://www.yelp.com/developers

Once you have the api key, create a `api-keys.json` file at the root of your repo and add your key there:

```
{
  "yelp": "<add your api key here>"
}
```

# Running

npm start
```
